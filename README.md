Tetris clone for PlayStation 2

Built this Tetris clone in 2005 (file date is 2005-06-27). I don't remember what library I used or anything else but I know it ran and worked on the PS2 hardware. Have tested the binary (located in the build directory) and it works with the PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2.
